Go Play Chess - Free Online Real time chess web server using websockets - Creator: Jonathan Chin<br><br>
12/10/2015 - Start date of project.<br><br>
5/31/2016 This project is officially open source. - All commit history has been cleared as some of the git history contained sensitive data. 
<br><br>
4/30/2017 I've decided to add a MUD. Chess and MUD's don't usually go together but by having them on the same web server and domain allows me to save server costs. More details will be revealed soon.
<br><br>
7/6/2019 The mud is being migrated to a different repository. The mud will be hosted on a different server.
<br><br>This project is a experimental project and only intended for my personal use.
